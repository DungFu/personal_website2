            <p>Hi, I am a software engineer! I currently work at Facebook on Android development. I enjoy biking, hiking, and video games. But most of all, I love to code. I am a proficient javascript web developer (front-end and back-end), 3D graphics programmer, and Android developer. I currently strive to master the art of crafting amazing games and 3D graphics experiences.</p>
            <p>I often go to hack-a-thons and have built some awesome projects over the years, ranging from music websites to Bash scripting. You can check out some of my favorites that I have built on my site!</p>
            <p>Whether it is circuit prototyping or GLSL shader development, I am always up for the challenge of learning something new and honing my skills. I have honed my skills in front-end javascipt and WebGL for the past year and I am hungering for new, harder problems to sink my teeth into.</p>

            <p><span class="content-title">Hacker News Reader Android App (2017)</span><br>Designed to take advantage of the Firebase api to allow quick and asynchronous fetching of stories/comments/etc. I use this app as my primary Hacker News reader app because it loads comments quickly and the design matches the original aesthetic of Hacker News. Not on the Google Play Store yet, but I plan on uploading it once a few more features are completed.<br>Code is on github: https://github.com/DungFu/HackerNews</p>
            <p><span class="content-title">Global Entry Appointment Cancellation Checker (2017)</span><br>This allows you to check and set up notifications for Global Entry enrollment appointment cancellations through the Global Online Enrollment System website. It uses PhantomJS, a headless browser, to log in and report back the first available open appointment. If one is found sooner than your current appointment, it will notify you by email/sms/pushbullet. It can make changes to your account or your appointment if you want that enabled. I heavily modified the original project to enable pushbullet support, and auto booking of earlier appointments.<br>Code is on github: https://github.com/DungFu/ge-cancellation-checker</p>
            <p><span class="content-title">Jello Simulator (2013)</span><br>A spring mesh simulation of jello-like material. This was done at a hackathon to learn how spring mesh simulations are done and as a personal challenge to see if I could actually complete it in such a short time.<br>Code is on github: https://github.com/DungFu/JelloSimulator</p>
